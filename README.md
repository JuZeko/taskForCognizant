<h1> GitHub only allows certain HTML elements and attributes inside their markdown so I'cant  display html template but I can use some pictures
 to show how template looks and what technology I use for this task </h1>
 
 <a>Hello, my names is Julius. In order to complete this task I used several technologies like Postman for fetching data from COVID-19 API because I needed to insert the Api key in the header, then I used the Json parser for sorting Json file, also used stripo templates it was much faster and more efficient way to get nice looking html code than writing by myself. 
For quick ckeck I added  all tasks in one  xml file in which all required tasks are completed and seperated with tags such as firstsTask, secondTask etc. For last task It was required select stored entries  I was not sure what do you mean by selecting should I put a tag or do something else, so I just separate top 3 countries with a biggest death toll. You also can check tasks one by one they are in seperated folders which contains Json file and xml  to make your life easier if you want to check data in  Json format. Below you will see how template look and  technologies I was using to complete this task. Thank you for your attention </a>
